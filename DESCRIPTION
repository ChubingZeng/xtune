Title: Regularized Regression with Differential Penalties Integrating External Information
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Chubing Zeng
Maintainer: Chubing Zeng <chubingz@usc.edu>
Description: This package extends standard penalized regression (Lasso and Ridge) to allow differential shrinkage based on external information with the goal of achieving a better prediction accuracy. Examples of external information include grouping of predictors, prior knowledge of biological importance, external p-values, function annotations, etc. The choice of multiple tuning parameters is done using an Empirical Bayes approach. A majorization-minimization algorithm is employed for implementation.
